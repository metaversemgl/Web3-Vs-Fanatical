# Web3-Vs-Fanatical
METAVERSE MGL is a group of experts in the field of knowledge-based .
The METAVERSE MGL team did not enter the Crypto market just for financial purposes.
if you read White Paper, you will find that such an idea has been in the minds of key people for years.
the people you see as a team now are just part of the team, many of the technologies that exist now were impossible before, but are now part of human memories.
According to White Paper, we said we were looking for web3, and as we said, projects like ICP we do not accept Web 3.
we did not say that we are looking to run Web 3 tomorrow.
I feel that many people judge things without reading MGL articles,our first goal is to Genesis Land(decentralized). finally we are looking to go to Web 3 with the collaborations we create in the future,According to our schedule, we will move to Web 3 technology after launching our own blockchain in the third season, not now. our team has already announced its readiness to cooperate in the field of Web 3 with a number of experts, and in the land of Genesis,we have built the foundations of an independent and intelligent earth.
One day no one thought humans would go into space, but it happened.
Maybe the Internet is not decentralized in anyone's imagination right now, but one day it will happen.
Some people, if they were in the days of Edison or Graham Bell, would call them crazy and not allow them to work.
